## Improvements needed.

## HMS and HFSAA certifications would be added when improved.

need to get locations on the map zoomed to Chicago area food locations.
also need to add navigation from the start location and to the desired searched location.
adding some pictures of the restaurant's main menu.
need to add a sidebar for the location's name and map area.

## Process reflections

I  had a hard time selecting a source, to go with Google or the Mapbox.
once the server showed some output  I felt, I can load it to GitHub and then suggest some improvements.

Still need to figure out how to add location navigation, even before styling.
